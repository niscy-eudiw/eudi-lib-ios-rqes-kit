# EUDI Remote Qualified Electronic Signature (RQES) Kit library for iOS

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Important!** Before you proceed, please read
the [EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation project description](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/.github/blob/main/profile/reference-implementation.md)

## Overview

This module provides the core functionality for the EUDI Wallet, focusing on the Remote Qualified
Electronic Signature (RQES) service. The `RQESService` interface defines methods for obtaining
credential authorization URLs, authorizing credentials, and signing documents. It ensures secure and
compliant electronic signatures by interacting with authorized credentials and handling document
signing processes.

## Installation
To use RQES Kit, add the following dependency to your Package.swift:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/niscy-eudiw/eudi-lib-ios-rqes-kit", branch: "initial")
]
```

Then add the Eudi Wallet package to your target's dependencies:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .product(name: "RqesKit", package: "eudi-lib-ios-rqes-kit"),
]
```

    Client ->>+ RQESServiceCredentialAuthorized: signDocuments(algorithmOID)
    RQESServiceCredentialAuthorized -->>- Client: SignedDocuments
```

## How to use

At first, construct an instance of the `RQESService` like shown below:

```swift
let cscClientConfig = CSCClientConfig(
    OAuth2Client: CSCClientConfig.OAuth2Client(
        clientId: "wallet-client",
        clientSecret: "somesecret2"
    ),
    authFlowRedirectionURI: "https://oauthdebugger.com/debug", rsspId: ""
)
var rqesService = await RQESService(
    clientConfig: cscClientConfig,
    defaultHashAlgorithmOID: .SHA256
)
```

To authorize the service, you need to get the authorization URL and open it in a browser. After the
user has authorized the service, the browser will be redirected to the `redirectUri`,
that
is configured in the `CSCClientConfig`, with a query parameter named `code` containing the
authorization code. You can then authorize the service by calling the `authorizeService` method:

```swift
let authorizationUrl = try await rqesService.getServiceAuthorizationUrl()

// Open the authorizationUrl in a browser
// After the user has authorized the service, the browser will be redirected to the redirectUri
// with a query parameter named "code" containing the authorization code

let authorizedService = try await rqesService.authorizeService(authorizationCode)
```

With the authorized service, you can list the available credentials by calling the `getCredentialsList`
method.

You can then select the credential you want to use, prepare the documents to sign, and get
the credential authorization URL by calling the `getCredentialAuthorizationUrl` method. After the
user has authorized the credential, you can authorize it by calling the `authorizeCredential`
method.

Finally, you can sign the documents by calling the `signDocuments` method.

```swift
let credentials = try await authorizedService.getCredentialsList()
// Use the credentials to select the one you want to use
// For example, select the first credential

let credential = credentials.first!
// Prepare the documents to sign
let documentURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "document", withExtension: "pdf")!
let unsignedDocuments = [Document(id: "Document to sign", fileURL: documentURL)]

// Get the credential authorization URL for the selected credential and documents
let credentialAuthorizationUrl = try await authorizedService.getCredentialAuthorizationUrl(
    credentialInfo: credential,
    documents: unsignedDocuments
)

// Use the credentialAuthorizationUrl to open a browser and let the user authorize the credential
// and get the authorization code from the redirect URI query parameter

// Authorize the credential
let authorizedCredential = try await authorizedService.authorizeCredential(authorizationCode)

// Sign the documents
let signAlgorithm = SigningAlgorithmOID.ECDSA_SHA256
let signedDocuments = try await authorizedCredential.signDocuments(signAlgorithmOID: signAlgorithm)
```
